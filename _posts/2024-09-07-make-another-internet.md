Oh, the Internet. It definitely has potential. But this one's fully shitted up now. It's not like, broken or anything; it's functional. It's disappointing in ways we fully understand, yet find ourselves unable to change. As parents, we collectively fret.

Where did we go wrong? The reviews are bots. The search results are bots. The posts are bots, the emails are bots, the replies are bots. Think of your favorite Internet place that isn't bots. Yeah, right, like that could exist. Someone right now is scraping it into an LLM and pointing a bot at it. You don't notice because you _can't notice_.

**Won't somebody stop the bots?!** Don't miss my point. We're not fixing the bot thing. The bots aren't going away. We clearly want the bots. Just admit it, you like the bots. They like you. (Literally!) They follow you when no one else is looking. They write "This gives yes" on review sites, so you don't _really_ have to decide what to buy or where to visit. My point isn't to stop the bots. We need to accept that these are totally the droids we're looking for.

So what's the problem? Well-- I don't know about you folks[^1], but I store my bank information on this thing. Yeah, right next to my social media account full of [tiny rubber hand shitposts](https://www.instagram.com/handsonandy/). The very same internet we put all the porn onto. Take a left at the culture war, walk on past the boomer-branded gambling apps, and there it is! Everyone's tax returns!

My point is this. The Internet isn't going to be the best answer to everything. It's got this one limiting quirk. That quirk is a sacred cow known as 'internet anonymity'. Not only is it the air that bots breathe, it's also a full-on techno-religion. You can't question it. You can't ask a government to interfere with it.

There's no migration path off of internet anonymity. The only option is to outcompete it. There's always going to be this primordial Internet bolted onto reality, like the PVP zone in your otherwise favorite game. But if there was another internet without that, some people would hang out there instead. If it's incentivized correctly, perhaps most would.

The remainder of this post is about that other choice. We're going to talk about a second internet that doesn't have internet anonymity. If that makes you angry, shut up! We're not touching your Internet! You've had plenty of time to do your idea! You can keep doing it! Let the rest of us try something else!

Here's the vision board for this new internet.

## Goals

- Authenticity in human interaction.
- Mirrors social dynamics in meatspace.
- Can administrate legal and governmental services.

## Identity

To get the ball rolling, we need a network-wide identity service. Call me old-fashioned, but I think it's fine if it's a centralized service. And I think it's double fine if it's administered by the government. We're not going to build another World Wide Web. I'll be speaking very U.S.-centric, because that's where I live, and that's all I know. We're going to build a Nation Wide Web. And every packet you send on it will be fingerprinted by a Real Human, who has been recognized by the government-orchestrated identity service. They won't know what's in those packets, but they will know who sent them.

I know, I know. You feel that outrage bubbling inside your chest. And you've been Pavlovian trained to lean into that instinct for attention points on the Anonymous Internet of Infinite Screams. But that's the _other_ Internet. If you're outraged, just keep using the other Internet. That's what it's for. I'm sure many bots will like your post and give you the dopamine you crave, and your Time On Site will skyrocket, and you'll all be very codependent and content. But this new internet doesn't have anything on it. So there's nothing sacred to be lost or threatened. So there's no reason to be angry. It's a big government panopticon as a **fundamental principle**. We're rolling with it!

## Authentication

Now imagine an entrepreneurial spirit who wants to host something on this new internet. They are asking you to sign up, which involves asserting your identity. Do you want this random entrepreneur knowing your name, your address, your email? I mean maybe they're benevolent. But maybe they're Mark Zuckerberg. So no thank you.

What you do instead, is implement a system like Mail Privacy Protection on Apple devices. The central identity service hashes the nebsite's[^2] identity, and generates a unique token which only they can link to your real identity. That becomes your unique identifier when you sign up for the nebsite. So the nebsite knows you're a Real Actual Human and not a bot, because they trust the central service. And all your actions on the nebsite can be attributed to a a single Real Actual Human. If you were to do crimes on that nebsite, the owner can rat you out to law enforcement. Hi, I'd like to report a crime and their ID is this. Law enforcement can then get a warrant to figure out who that ID points at. Or something. I'm not a lawyer. All I know is you can't bot it.

## Sir, Please Show Yourself Out

Check it out, we've already solved two major unsolvable problems on that _other_ Internet.

One: Bots can't sign up for services. Nebsites could let you sign up multiple times, but it'd all be with the same ID, so behind the scenes they'd know what all your alt accounts are and can do something or nothing with that knowledge. You could automate your actions, but they're still _your_ actions. There's no hiding that. You are responsible for everything your bot does. And you care about that because...

Two: There are consequences for actions. You can't simply get another identity from the central service. You only have the one. And if you fuck it up, it's gonna be some DMV shit to fix it. However _that_ ends up working, you aren't gonna want to do it. So don't fuck it up. Kind of like how you go out into society every day of your life and don't end up in jail. Don't ask me why that seems so foreign an idea for a digital world. Probably because this current Internet we're all on right now has the societal structure of The Purge, and our brains are smoldering from unbounded psychic damage, and we've forgotten how to dream. If I had to guess.

If a nebsite bans you for some period of time, there's no way to circumvent it. Think of how easy this makes moderation, and at scale! You could be a Very Large Online Platform and know that at max, you'd need to ban about 330M accounts, ever. Because that's how many people there are in the country. To put the fundamental difference there into perspective, consider that [Twitter was banning](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/06/twitter-is-sweeping-out-fake-accounts-like-never-before-putting-user-growth-risk/) 1M accounts, _per day_. If those were all humans, Twitter would have put itself out of business in less than a year. So, like, they're all bots.

## You Are Born

Okay this one's fun. You don't just get free reign when you join this new internet. You have a birthdate. I don't care how old you are in meatspace. The day you get your ID you're 1 day old. A year later, you're 1 year old.

All that common sense legislation you're wishing the current Internet has? We can do that now. Want to enforce existing age restrictions on websites about nicotine, alcohol, gambling, nudity, etc? No problem. Incredibly easy to implement. Are we all feeling like there should be some kind of age restriction on social media? Maybe nobody under 16 can be on any service that exposes them to content from more than 100,000 other users? I don't know, ask a psychologist. Whatever it is, we can implement it. Can't do that on the current Internet. Go ahead, try.

Why not have the identity authority set your internet age to your meatspace age when you sign up, since they're confirming your identity anyway? Couple of reasons.

Let me share my lived experience. I got on the Internet in the 1990's when I was a teen. I was keyboard warrioring on message boards. Casting flamebait. Feeding trolls. Getting catfished and scammed. Been on this thing for over 20 years now, and I've got a lot of wisdom learned the hard way. Now my meatspace elders, well into their 5th and 6th decades of meatlife, they didn't get online until the 2010's. What have they spent the past decade doing? Keyboard warrioring on social media. Casting flamebait. Feeding trolls. Getting catfished and scammed. Maybe they'll chill the fuck out sometime in the 2030's. I think internets need on-ramps. I don't care how old you are in meatspace, you're not ready for this shit on day 1. You need gutter bumpers.

Second reason is to slow adoption so that the other Internet can't readily imprint itself onto the new one. We're trying to build something durable, we can take our time. For the first century or so, we'll have people whose meatspace age doesn't match their internet age. That's fine, we're all digital children. It means there won't be any porn or nicotine pouches on it for a couple of decades. I'm not a prude! I'm not thinking of the children! You just have to continue enjoying that stuff on the other Internet. Which is totally still there and totally fine. This new internet's doing its own thing. Once it's had time to bake and it's a part of everyday life, you'll be born into that 22nd century society and your meatspace age will line up nicely with your digital age. Until then, gutter bumpers.

## Okay, How Do We Build It?

I'm hoping this post inspires some incredibly smart, technical, detail-oriented people who want to spend their time thinking about that with me. For one, we probably need a way to implement this on the existing hardware network. I doubt we want to build another one of those. If you're interested, reach out. I'd tell you exactly how to do that, but this Internet is full of bots.
