a13o is Andrew Pellerano.

I use this space to publish my thoughts and ideas to the world.

There's no publishing cadence and there never will be. The best way to passively follow along is to use this site's <i class="fa fa-rss"></i> <a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a> feed.

You can also follow me at <i class="fa fa-github"></i>  [a13o](https://github.com/a13o) and <i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> [andrewpellerano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewpellerano/).
